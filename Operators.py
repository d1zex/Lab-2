#Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
#In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 5) 

x = 5
y = 2
print(x % y)


x = 2
y = 5
print(x ** y) #same as 2*2*2*2*2

x = 15
y = 2
print(x // y)
#the floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number

#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
x = 5
print(x)

x = 5
x += 3
print(x)

x = 5
x -= 3
print(x)


x = 5
x *= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x /= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x%=3
print(x)

x = 5
x//=3
print(x)

x = 5
x **= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x &= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x |= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x ^= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x >>= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x <<= 3
print(x)

print(x := 3)
